1. Pulling out round number and time information from tick numbers.
  * [[tick information (128 tick)]]
  * 
  * Create function that can take a tick and calculate context info:
    * round #
    * time left (in phase)
    * phase (freeze time, play time, bomb time, post-round time)
      - round_start, round_freeze_end, bomb_planted,
        bomb_exploded,bomb_defused, [[round_end]], round_officially_ended
        - round_officially_ended seems to always be on the same tick as round_start
      - 
2. Identify the first kill of a round and determine its effect on the the
   probability of that team winning the round.
   * Use player_spawn to identify which userids are associated with which teams (2 = T, 3 = CT)
