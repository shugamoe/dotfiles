* Installing packages globally
  - npm install -g <package_name>
  - npm link <package_name>
* Installing packages locally (better)
  - npm init (create package.json file)
  - npm install <package_name> for packages that module should be shipped with
  - npm install -D <package_name> for dev but not production dependent packages
    like jasmine-node, eslint, and what not
